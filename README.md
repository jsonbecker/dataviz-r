This tutorial will teach you how to use Plotly and Shiny in R to create interactive data visualizations. The first part of the tutorial is interactive and uses the [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) R package to teach you plotly in your web browser or RStudio viewer. In the second part of the tutorial, switch to opening the numbered .R files in RStudio. You can still follow along in the tutorial for the second half.

# Set Up 
1. [Download](https://cran.r-project.org/) and install R
2. [Download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/) and install RStudio. Make sure you have the latest versions!
3. Inside RStudio go to Tools -> Install Packages and install learnr, plotly, shiny, shinythemes, and all dependencies. If the install of any of the packages fails because of dependencies, be sure to search for and install the dependency then try to install the package again. If you have any of these packages already, be sure to update them. You can also install these packages from the R command line in RStudio with `install.packages(c('learnr','plotly','shiny','shinythemes'), dependencies = TRUE)`.
4. Download or clone this repository
5. Open the plotly_shiny_tutorial_v2.Rmd file in RStudio and hit the green arrow where it says "Run Document."
6. After finishing the first part of the tutorial, open a new RStudio instance and open the .R files to work on the second part of the tutorial on Shiny. You can still follow along in the tutorial.
